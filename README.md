# JC-Programming-Language
A self-made programming language.
This is a WIP python compiler that compiles to LLVM-IR assembly language, (and then this code will be compiled to machine code). This project was initially implemented in Python, however as a further challange I started again using C (see the 'C_branch' for this alternative version).
